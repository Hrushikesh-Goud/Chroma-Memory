    <h1>Game Rules</h1>
    <p>Welcome to the Memory Game! Here are the rules:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The game starts when you press any button.</li>
        <li>A colored box will blink, indicating the start of the sequence.</li>
        <li>After the first blink, you need to repeat the sequence by pressing the correct color.</li>
        <li>Each round, the sequence will add one more blink to the existing sequence.</li>
        <li>You must remember and repeat the entire sequence in the correct order.</li>
        <li>If you press the wrong color, the game will end and you have to start over.</li>
        <li>Try to see how long you can remember and correctly repeat the sequence!</li>
        <li>Good luck and have fun!</li>
